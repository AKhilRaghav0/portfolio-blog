I'm a developer from India with a passion for building native, easy-to-use software. My expertise lies in Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit (programmatically). I also have experience with C++, HTML, CSS, and basic knowledge of JavaScript & TensorflowJS.

My focus is on creating functional and user-friendly applications with a keen eye for design. I enjoy tackling complex problems and transforming them into elegant solutions. Whether it's writing code or designing interfaces, I strive for simplicity, beauty, and intuitiveness in my work.

Feel free to reach out to me at [work@akhilraghav.cloud](mailto:work@akhilraghav.cloud) if you have any questions or would like to connect. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
